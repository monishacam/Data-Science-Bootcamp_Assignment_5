Observations

1. In all 3 pie charts it can be seen that urban cities hold a good percentage of total fares, rides, and drivers.
2. Rural cities hold the smallest numbers when it comes to total fares, rides, drivers, and this is because rural areas are very barren so they dont require as much transportation.
3. There seems to be a negative correlation when it comes to average fare and total rides. As the number of rides increases, the average fare goes down.
